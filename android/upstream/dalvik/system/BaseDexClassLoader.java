     * for the default package.
     *
     * <p>There is a limited chance that we end up with multiple
     * {@code Package} objects representing the same package: It can
     * happen when when a package is scattered across different JAR
     * files which were loaded by different {@code ClassLoader}
     * instances. This is rather unlikely, and given that this whole
